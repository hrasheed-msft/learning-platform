# Khwarizmi — Backend Implementation Agent

**Focus:** Games engine, child auth, dashboard API, seed data generation, TTS/audio services

## Quick Status

**TTS Audio Player & Sync (2026-05-20):** ✅ COMPLETE
- Azure AI Speech S0 integration for pre-generated audio
- Word-level timestamps via `wordBoundary` event
- SSML chunking with voice switching for bilingual content
- AudioCache model with duration and timestamp storage

**Games Backend (2026-05-17):** ✅ COMPLETE
- 8 enums, 14 models, 3 services, 15 API endpoints
- SRS writeback, streak system (1-day grace), time budget enforcement
- Game-type whitelist, difficulty caps, parental controls

**Parent Dashboard + Child Auth (2026-05-17):** ✅ COMPLETE
- 4 dashboard endpoints, 3 notification endpoints
- Child Auth: username/password, dual JWT (parent/child)

---

## Architecture Decisions

- Parental controls: Whitelist model; empty = all allowed; non-empty = restricted
- Streak grace period: 1-day miss allowed per streak
- SRS writeback: Game answers feed into FlashCardProgress with SM-2 ratings
- Activity tracking: recordActivity() helper ready for quiz/flashcard/course integration
- Daily challenge: Deterministic seed ensures all users get same challenge per day

## Key Learnings & Patterns

### Backend-Frontend Contract (2026-05-17 onwards)
- TypeScript types ARE the API contract in parallel development
- Response shapes must match exactly; test field names carefully
- Example: `eligibleCourses` vs `courses`, `courseTitle` vs `courseName`
- Pattern: Always check frontend extraction code first, then emit that exact shape

### Postgres Enum Migration (2026-05-18)
- Can't drop enum values still referenced
- Pattern: `GameType_new`, ALTER each column with `USING (CASE ... END)`, DROP old, RENAME
- Array columns need `DROP DEFAULT` before swap
- Sequence: drop array default → ALTER columns → DROP TYPE → RENAME → re-add default

### Content Selection Fallback (2026-05-17)
- selectContent was filtering by exact difficulty and returning 0 when no match
- Fixed with fallback to any-difficulty when exact match empty
- Resolves "game start returns success=false" silent failures

### Azure TTS Details (2026-05-20)
- Audio duration in 100-nanosecond ticks: divide by 10,000,000 for seconds
- SSML `<lang>` tags switch voice mid-narration for bilingual content
- AudioCache blockIndex=-1 sentinel for full-unit audio (not null)

### Video Generation Pipeline (2026-05-20)
- Narrated slide-deck: Puppeteer → PNG, TTS per-slide, ffmpeg stitch
- Dockerfile: `node:20-alpine` → `node:20-slim` (Debian) for Chromium
- Fire-and-forget async with database status tracking (generating→ready→failed)
- Use `--no-sandbox` + `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium` in Container Apps

### Idempotent Operations (2026-05-18)
- New simple-enroll endpoint: POST /api/v1/courses/:courseId/enroll (idempotent)
- Returns 200 + existing record if already enrolled (not 409 ConflictError)
- Lets frontend fire-and-forget without error handling

## Session History (Recent)

### 2026-05-24 — TTS Arabic Term Normalization + Heading Breaks
**Orchestration Log:** `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-05-24T14-34-31Z-khwarizmi.md`

✅ **COMPLETE**

**Deliverables:**
- `preprocessTtsHtml()` — Normalize HTML before SSML generation
- `extractSynthesisBlocks()` — Preserve heading blocks for separate pause handling
- Updated `buildVoiceElements()` — Handle marked Arabic text (`[[ar]]...[[/ar]]`)
- Tests added to `src/__tests__/audio.test.ts`

**Key Improvements:**
1. Arabic terms now emit: "Translation صالح/(transliteration)" (normalized format)
2. Section headings have explicit pause markers (`[[break:800ms]]` before, `[[break:500ms]]` after)
3. Intelligent voice-element merging (inline Arabic <4 words stays with English voice)

**Build & Validation:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅
- `npm run test:ci` ✅
- `npm run build` ✅

**Decision Created:** #23 — TTS Arabic Term Normalization + Heading Breaks (2026-05-24)
